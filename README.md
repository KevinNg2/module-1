# module-1
Module-1 features starter code that I have modifed. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.
In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
All the links are working properly, The CSS has been consolidated to make it more organized following the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and includes comments before each element and section of the page.
The Main Focus on this project goes as follows:
semantic HTML elements
When viewing the HTML elements it follows a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
The image elements have accessible alt attributes
The heading attributes fall in sequential order
The title element has a concise, descriptive title

The Second Focus of this project is creating a repository and upload work on Github. The repository contains the following:
Live URL
No Errors in Live Application
GitHub URL will be submitted
Repository contains application code
Repository has a unique name
Repository has comments in HTML and CSS
