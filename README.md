# module-1
Module-1 features starter code that I have modifed. This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.
In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.
All the links are working properly, The CSS has been consolidated to make it more organized following the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and includes comments before each element and section of the page.
